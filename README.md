Here’s a simple and professional `README.md` for your **Disease Prediction Web App** project:

---

# 🧠 Simple Disease Prediction Web App

This is a beginner-level disease prediction web application created using **HTML and CSS** for the frontend and a **pretrained machine learning model** in the backend. The application is designed to be **easily accessible via a `.bat` file**, which automatically installs dependencies and opens the app in the browser.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* 🌐 Simple user interface made with HTML and CSS
* 🤖 Uses a pretrained model for predicting diseases based on user input
* 🖱️ No manual setup needed – just run the `.bat` file
* 📦 Automatically downloads required dependencies
* 🌍 Opens the app in your default web browser

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔹 Step 1: Download or Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease-prediction-app.git
cd disease-prediction-app
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Run the App

Just double-click the `run_app.bat` file.

This will:

* Create a virtual environment (if not already present)
* Install required dependencies (`Flask`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)
* Start the server
* Automatically open the app in your browser

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

1. Enter symptoms or relevant input in the form.
2. Click submit.
3. The app uses the pretrained model to predict the disease and display the result.
